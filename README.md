**"DISSATISFIED"** is a texture pack crafted for those who feel that Minecraft’s default textures could use a refreshing touch.

This pack brings you a complete redesign of the game’s visuals, enhancing and reimagining the elements that didn’t quite hit the mark. Our goal is to give Minecraft a more polished and engaging look while maintaining its iconic charm.

So far, we’ve overhauled item designs, revamped the entire game GUI with a sleek and modern style, and made countless improvements to bring a new level of immersion to your gameplay.

**Key Features:**

- Redesigned tools, weapons, and items with sharper, more detailed aesthetics.
- A smoother and more vibrant GUI that makes navigating the game more intuitive.
- Countless tweaks and adjustments to enhance the overall visual experience.

**Compatibility:**
Currently, the texture pack is compatible only with Minecraft 1.20.2+ due to changes in GUI textures organization introduced in this version. However, once the pack is fully complete, it will support a wider range of versions, ensuring more players can enjoy its unique style.
